# SPARC - Systemized Policy and Regulatory Controls

SPARC is a powerful control catalog management platform purpose-built to streamline and modernize how organizations manage, track, and implement NIST 800-53 (and related) security and privacy controls. SPARC empowers security and compliance teams by transforming static control catalogs into dynamic, machine-readable, policy-as-code artifacts that integrate directly into DevSecOps pipelines.

## 🚀 What is SPARC?

**SPARC (Systemized Policy and Regulatory Controls)** is a control catalog management solution that centralizes, normalizes, and operationalizes compliance frameworks such as:

- NIST 800-53 Rev. 5
- Baselines (Low, Moderate, High)
- CNSSI 1253
- ISO 27001, CIS Benchmarks (via mappings)
- Custom internal control overlays

SPARC helps teams manage the lifecycle of controls while enabling automation through structured, versioned control data in **machine-readable formats** such as [OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language)](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/).

## 🔧 Key Features

- **📚 Unified Control Catalog**: Centralized management of one or many control baselines (NIST, FedRAMP, custom overlays)
- **🧩 Control Mappings**: Support for cross-framework mappings (e.g., NIST to ISO or CIS)
- **⚙️ Policy-as-Code Generation**: Export control requirements as YAML, Rego, JSON, or HCL to integrate into:
  - Infrastructure-as-code
  - CI/CD pipeline enforcement
  - Runtime security policies
- **🔍 Traceability and Justification**: Attach test plans, automated evidence, or manual assertions to controls
- **📤 OSCAL Native**: Import and export OSCAL-formatted control catalogs, system security plans (SSPs), and implementation plans
- **🔐 RBAC & Audit Trails**: Ensure integrity and oversight of catalog updates

## 🧠 Why SPARC?

Traditional compliance methods are manual, siloed, and slow. SPARC replaces spreadsheets and static documents with a **machine-actionable source of truth**, enabling:

| Benefit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔄 Automation | Drive real-time enforcement of security controls via policy-as-code |
| 📈 Scalability | Manage thousands of controls and mappings across multiple environments |
| ✅ Audit Readiness | Generate OSCAL-aligned artifacts for faster ATO (Authority to Operate) |
| 🧪 Integration | Plug into GitLab, Terraform, OPA/Gatekeeper, Jenkins, and more |
